    // You might think we can just do something like this:

  //here we have made a change in team array but change will also be shown in 
  //players array because team array has made a refrence to players array
  // and not a new array
}



// trying to make new array instead of references

 const team2 = players.slice();












    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team3 =[].concat(players);
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
const team4 = [...players];

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80

    // and think we make a copy:
//const captain = person;
//captain.number = 99;
    // how do we take a copy instead?
const cap2 =Object.assign({},person,{number:99, age:12});
console.log(cap2);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
//const cap3={...person};
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
